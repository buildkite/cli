# Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community to make Buildkite `cli` project even better.

## Getting Started

To get started with contributing, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository and clone it to your local machine.
2. Create a feature branch with a nice name (`git checkout -b cli-new-feature`) for your changes
3. Write your code
    * Make sure your code is correctly formatted by running go fmt ./..., and that the tests are passing by running go test ./...
5. Commit your changes and push them to your forked repository.
7. Submit a pull request with a detailed description of your changes and linked to any relevant issues.

The team maintaining this codebase will review your PR and start a CI build for it. For security reasons, we don't automatically run CI against forked repos, and a human will review your PR prior to its CI running.

## Reporting Issues

If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please open an issue on the GitHub repository. Provide as much detail as possible, including steps to reproduce the issue.

If we're really dragging our feet on reviewing a PR, please feel free to ping us through GitHub or Slack, or get in touch with [support@buildkite.com](mailto:support@buildkite.com), and they can bug us to get things done :) 

Happy contributing!
