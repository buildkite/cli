This document outlines areas for improvement in the Buildkite CLI codebase. Each improvement is organized by category and includes a description of the issue and a suggested approach. Engineers can check off items as they are completed.

## Code Duplication

- [x] **Consolidate UI Rendering Logic**
  - The codebase has multiple implementations of similar UI rendering logic across different packages (e.g., `internal/build/view`, `internal/cluster/view`, `internal/agent/view`)
  - Create a common UI component library in a central package that can be shared

- [ ] **Unify Error Handling**
  - Different approaches to error handling exist across the codebase
  - Standardize error creation and handling, especially for API errors

- [ ] **Extract Common HTTP Client Logic**
  - HTTP request setup with authorization appears in multiple places
  - Create a common HTTP client wrapper with standard headers and error handling

- [ ] **Consolidate API Response Processing**
  - Similar code for processing API responses exists in multiple files
  - Extract into reusable utility functions

- [ ] **Merge Similar Command Execution Patterns**
  - Many commands follow the same pattern of resolving resources, making API calls, and displaying results
  - Extract this pattern into a reusable framework for command execution

## Code Organization

- [ ] **Standardize Package Structure**
  - Some related functionality is spread across multiple packages
  - Reorganize packages to better align with domain concepts

  - Add a simple caching layer for API responses

- [ ] **Reduce Memory Allocations**
  - Some operations create unnecessary temporary objects
  - Optimize memory usage in hot paths

- [ ] **Lazy Loading of Resources**
  - Some resources are loaded eagerly when they might not be used
  - Implement lazy loading for expensive resources

- [ ] **More Efficient Data Structures**
  - Some operations use inefficient data structures (e.g., linear search in slices)
  - Use more appropriate data structures for lookups

## Testing Improvements

- [ ] **Increase Test Coverage**
  - Test coverage is inconsistent across packages
  - Add more unit tests, especially for core functionality

- [ ] **Create Standard Test Helpers**
  - Similar test setup code exists in multiple test files
  - Create standard test helpers for common operations

- [ ] **Improve Mock Implementation**
  - Current mocking approach is not consistent
  - Standardize how API responses are mocked

- [ ] **Add Integration Tests**
  - Most tests are unit tests
  - Add integration tests for key user flows

- [ ] **Implement Property-Based Testing**
  - Current tests only cover specific examples
  - Add property-based tests for complex logic

## User Experience

- [ ] **Standardize Help Text**
  - Help text formatting varies across commands
  - Create a consistent style for all help text

- [ ] **Improve Error Messages**
  - Some error messages are too technical
  - Make error messages more user-friendly and actionable

- [ ] **Add Progress Indicators**
  - Not all long-running operations show progress
  - Add progress indicators for all operations that take more than a second

- [ ] **Enhance Command Autocomplete**
  - Current autocomplete support is basic
  - Improve shell integration for better autocomplete

- [ ] **Add Interactive Modes**
  - Many commands require full arguments upfront
  - Add interactive modes for complex commands

## Documentation

- [ ] **Add Code Comments**
  - Some complex code lacks explanatory comments
  - Add comments explaining the "why" not just the "what"

- [ ] **Create Consistent API Documentation**
  - API documentation style varies
  - Standardize API documentation format

- [ ] **Improve README Examples**
  - README examples don't cover all common use cases
  - Expand examples to cover more scenarios

- [ ] **Add Architecture Documentation**
  - High-level architecture is not documented
  - Create architecture diagrams and documentation

- [ ] **Document Design Patterns**
  - Several design patterns are used without explanation
  - Document the design patterns used and why

## Specific Code Issues

- [ ] **Remove Duplicated HTTP Client Configuration**
  - `pkg/cmd/api/api.go` and `internal/config/token.go` have similar HTTP client setup
  - Extract to a common utility

- [x] **Consolidate View Rendering Logic**
  - `internal/build/view/view.go`, `internal/agent/view.go`, and `internal/cluster/view.go` have similar rendering logic
  - Create a common rendering framework

- [ ] **Unify Command Execution Flow**
  - Most command execution in `pkg/cmd/*/` follows similar patterns
  - Create a standardized command execution framework

- [ ] **Standardize GraphQL Query Handling**
  - GraphQL queries in `internal/*/*.graphql` are handled inconsistently
  - Create a consistent approach to GraphQL queries

- [x] **Fix Inconsistent Error Handling in Resolvers**
  - Error handling in `internal/pipeline/resolver/` and `internal/build/resolver/` is inconsistent
  - Standardize error handling approach

- [ ] **Simplify Configuration Management**
  - Configuration handling in `internal/config/config.go` is complex
  - Simplify and document the configuration system

- [ ] **Improve Testing for Validation Logic**
  - Validation logic in `internal/validation/` lacks comprehensive tests
  - Add more test cases for validation rules

- [ ] **Clean Up Command Flag Handling**
  - Flag handling in various command files is inconsistent
  - Create a standardized approach to flag definition and processing

- [ ] **Consolidate Formatter Logic**
  - Formatting logic for various data types is spread across the codebase
  - Create a central formatting package

- [ ] **Reduce Global State**
  - Some packages rely on global state or singletons
  - Refactor to reduce reliance on global state

## Technical Debt

- [ ] **Update Dependencies**
  - Some dependencies may be outdated
  - Review and update all dependencies

- [ ] **Remove Deprecated Code**
  - Some code is marked as deprecated but still exists
  - Remove deprecated code and provide migration paths

- [ ] **Fix TODOs in Codebase**

  - Address all TODO comments

- [ ] **Improve Error Messages Translation Support**
  - Error messages are hardcoded in English
  - Add support for translating error messages

- [ ] **Refactor Large Functions**
  - Some functions are too long and do too many things
  - Break down large functions into smaller, focused functions

## New Features

- [ ] **Implement Proper Logging System**
  - Current logging is inconsistent and mostly uses fmt
  - Implement a proper structured logging system

- [ ] **Add Telemetry (Optional)**
  - No usage telemetry exists
  - Add optional telemetry to understand how commands are used

- [ ] **Enhance Configuration System**

## Priority Recommendations

Based on the analysis, I recommend focusing on these items first:

1. **Consolidate UI Rendering Logic** - This will give immediate benefits in code maintainability
2. **Standardize Error Handling** - Inconsistent error handling causes confusion and bugs
3. **Extract Common HTTP Client Logic** - Will reduce duplication in a core area
4. **Increase Test Coverage** - Will prevent regressions during refactoring
5. **Create Standard Test Helpers** - Will make adding new tests easier

These improvements would provide the most benefit for the effort required and would make subsequent improvements easier.
